Website for reporting ROBLOX users.

# Description

**Reportz**, Created by Henry, was made in 2025 to combat ROBLOX's pedophile protection streak. We aim to not take action against roblox but exercise game owners' right to treat different users differently in their game. 

## How does it work?
1. An user reports another user based on evidence and context.
2. This gets sent to our review team to decide whether this person is actually a pedo or not. (Their full username needs to be included).
3. If yes: our database gets updated to include that person, if no: then the report gets deleted.
4. Developers can send an API request with a player's *UserID* to see if that person is in their database; They can do with that what they want.
